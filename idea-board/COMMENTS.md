# Developer Comments

Following are the points those are managed to be completed in this Idea Board Assignment

1. Page is fully responsive.
2. Each idea tile contains a title and description, which is editable, as well as created/updated time.
3. New ideas have the title field focused to prompt user to begin typing.
4. Add the ability to sort ideas by modification date or alphabetically.
5. Utilising localStorage API to persist current state when the page is refreshed.
6. Character countdown as the user is approaching the limit of their description text.
7. Add an unobtrusive notification when an update is made to a tile.
8. Unit tests using Enzyme

During this exercise I could improve the code by doing the following

1. Using a CSS pre-processor to organize the css code or use StyledComponents.
2. Using React-Router so in future if we wanted to use this project for more complex application then it could be used easily.
3. Similarly we could Redux (React-router and redux are not used as this application is not that complex).
4. Using webpack for building the project. 

Above would take the code to be more real world production code.
